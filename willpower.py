# Define your functions here

# 1. Define a function that returns the string "Stop Bullying!" if Angelica has bullied any babies.
#    If she has bullied zero babies, return the string "Good job, Angelica."

def perfect_day(bullied_babies):
   return

# 2. Not every day can be a perfect day. Let's write a function for a "good_day" of no bullying.
#    If Angelica has bullied fewer than three babies, it should return a string that congratulates her.
#    If Angelica has bullied exactly three babies, let's return a string telling her to stop now.
#    If Angelica has bullied more than three babies, let's return a string scolding her for bullying too many.



# 3. The longer Angelica is consistently not bullying, the more we feel we can trust her. Let's write a flex_day function.
#    Let's write a function that takes in two arguments - a goal number of bullied babies and current number of bullied babies.
#    It will do the same as the previous function did, so calling flex_day(2, 3) should return a scolding string, since she ate one more than her goal.



# 4. CHALLENGE: Being nice isn't only about not bullying naive babies, cutting out the bad; it's also about being actively nice to them.
#    Let's define a function called balanced_bully that takes in two arguments - a number of bullied babies and a number of hugged babies.
#    If Angelica has hugged more babies than she has bullied, congratulate her!
#    If Angelica has the same amount for each, warn her that she should hug a baby next.
#    If Angelica has more babies that she bullied rather than hugged, tell her to get back on track. 
#    If Angelica has hugged some babies and has not bullied at all, give her a special congratulations.
#    If Angelica has neither hugged nor bullied any babies, encourage her to do something - preferably hug a baby.
